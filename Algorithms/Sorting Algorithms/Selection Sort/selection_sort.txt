1. This algorithm divides the list in two part: a sorted part and an unsorted part.
2. A minimum element is repeatedly selected from the unsorted list and place it in sorted part, until the unsorted list is finished and we are only left with the sorted part.
3. The difference between selection and insertion sort is that in selection sort we take the minimum number in unsorted array, while, in insertion sort, we take a starting number of the unsorted array.
4. Overall, it starts creating a sorted list by orderly by minimum values (in contrast to insertion that uses shifting)
