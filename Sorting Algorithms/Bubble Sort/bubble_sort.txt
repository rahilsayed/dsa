1. It is the simplest sorting algorithm, but also quite slow.
2. Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
3. Each iteration results in the largest element being swapped at the last position.
4. Hence, at each iteration, we reduce the range of sorting iteration by 1 position from last.
