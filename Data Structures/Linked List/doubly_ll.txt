What is a doubly linked list?
  -  A doubly linked list maintains an extra pointer to the previous node in addition to the pointer to the next node as in singly linked list.

1. Each node has a prev and next pointer
2. Prev of first node points to null.
3. Next of last node points to null.

Inserting an element in doubly linked list can have three cases:

1. Inserting an element in the beginning of the doubly linked list.
2. Inserting an element at the end of the doubly linked list.
3. Insert an element at after an element in the doubly linked list.
