Infix Expression: Infix Expression is of the form variable1 operator variable2

Examples are :

    1. a + b
    2. (a+b) - (a-b)

PostFix Expression: Postfix Expression is of the form variable1 variable2 operator. They are notations to express expressions without bracket.

Examples are :

    1. ab+
    2. ab+cd+

How can we convert from Infix to Postfix:

Before we try to find how can we can convert this? Lets try to understand how would we have done this manually, and what we need to convert the expression?

For example:

We have to convert [operand1 operator operator2] to [operand1 operand2 operator] for converting infix to postfix operation, considering precedence of the operators.

To convert (a+b) - (a-b):

    1. () takes first precedence, hence we will convert (a+b) to ab+ and store this somewhere.
    2. Next - is stored somewhere.
    3. Next we will convert (a-b) to ab- and store this somewhere.
    4. Then we will take both ab+, ab- and - operator in between, and hence, will convert      [operand1  operator operator2] to [operand1 operand 2 operator] i.e ab+ab--

Operator Precedence:

[+,-]  <  [*,/,%]  <  [^]
